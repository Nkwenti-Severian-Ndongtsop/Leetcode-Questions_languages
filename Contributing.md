# Contributing to [LeetCode-Solutions](https://github.com/lxmn-22/Leetcode-Questions) Repository

### Hey coder! ðŸ‘‹

Thank you for considering contributing to this repository! Your contributions will help others learn and grow by sharing your LeetCode solutions. Please take a moment to review the guidelines below before submitting your contributions.

### How to Contribute

#### 1. Fork the Repository

Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account. You can do this by clicking the **Fork** button at the top of the repository page.

#### 2. Clone Your Fork

Clone your fork of the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lxmn-22/leetcode-solutions.git

cd leetcode-solutions
```

#### 3. Create a New Branch

```bash
git checkout -b add-solution-<question-title>
```

#### 4. Add Your Solution

- Go to the relevant problem folder or create a new folder if it does not exist.

- File names should follow this format: problemname.(extention -> py or js etc.)
  
    For example: HappyNumber.py for Python or AddTwoPromises.js for Javascript.

- Add a comment at the top of your file with:
  
    The problem statement.

- Example for Javascript solution:
```js
/*
Given two promises promise1 and promise2, return a new promise. promise1 and promise2 
will both resolve with a number. The returned promise should resolve with the sum of 
the two numbers.

Example 1:
Input: 
promise1 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(2), 20)), 
promise2 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(5), 60))
Output: 7
Explanation: The two input promises resolve with the values of 2 and 5 respectively. 
The returned promise should resolve with a value of 2 + 5 = 7. The time the returned 
promise resolves is not judged for this problem.

Example 2:
Input: 
promise1 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(10), 50)), 
promise2 = new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(() => resolve(-12), 30))
Output: -2
Explanation: The two input promises resolve with the values of 10 and -12 respectively. 
The returned promise should resolve with a value of 10 + -12 = -2.
*/
/**
 * @param {Promise} promise1
 * @param {Promise} promise2
 * @return {Promise}
 */
var addTwoPromises = async function(promise1, promise2) {
    const[value1, value2] = await Promise.all([promise1, promise2]);
    return value1 + value2;
};

/**
 * addTwoPromises(Promise.resolve(2), Promise.resolve(2))
 *   .then(console.log); // 4
 */
```

#### 5. Commit and Push Your Changes

After you've added your solution, commit your changes:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Added solution for <question-title>"
```

Push your branch to your forked repository:

```bash
git push origin add-solution-<question-title>
```

#### 6. Submit a Pull Request

Go to the original repository and create a new pull request from your branch. Please provide a detailed description of the problem and the solution youâ€™re contributing.

#### 7. Wait for Review

Repository maintainer will review your submission and provide feedback if necessary. Once approved, your solution will be merged into the repository!
